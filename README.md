# MRI-scan

***Don't forget to put a star***

The code modifies the original MRI image and transforms it into a filtered image. It then saves the filtered data to a CSV file. Finally, it displays the original and filtered images using the matplotlib library.

Also, for more accuracy and usability, you can create the documentation for this project in the form of a Jupyter #Notebook file and use #Markdown # to explain the code and various steps. Plus, you can display images, charts, and tables inside the notebook
